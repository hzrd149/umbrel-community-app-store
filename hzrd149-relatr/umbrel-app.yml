  Relatr is a decentralized web of trust metric service for Nostr that computes personalized trust scores by combining social graph distances with profile validation metrics.
  Relatr measures relative trust between Nostr public keys by analyzing social graph proximity and validating profile characteristics. It uses a weighted scoring system to produce a comprehensive trust metric that can be personalized from any source pubkey's perspective.

  - add capping config and update rate limit defaults

  The service is designed to be resource-efficient with minimal hardware requirements, requiring only 256MB RAM and 256MB storage for basic operation.
