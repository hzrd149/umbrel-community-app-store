description: >-
  Relatr is a decentralized web of trust metric service for Nostr that computes personalized trust scores by combining social graph distances with profile validation metrics.
  Relatr measures relative trust between Nostr public keys by analyzing social graph proximity and validating profile characteristics. It uses a weighted scoring system to produce a comprehensive trust metric that can be personalized from any source pubkey's perspective.

  Features:
  - Web-Based Configuration UI: Manage environment variables through a browser interface
  - Social Graph Analysis: Calculates trust distances using nostr-social-graph
  - Profile Validation: Validates NIP-05, Lightning addresses, and event publications
  - Reciprocity Checking: Verifies mutual follow relationships
  - Configurable Scoring: Flexible weighting schemes for different trust factors
  - Persistent Caching: SQLite-based caching for performance optimization
  - MCP Server Interface: Model Context Protocol API for integration

  The service is designed to be resource-efficient with minimal hardware requirements, requiring only 256MB RAM and 256MB storage for basic operation.
releaseNotes: |
  Performance Improvements:
  - Streaming data processing for pubkey metadata prevents memory accumulation
  - Scales efficiently to larger network sizes without O(n) memory growth
  - Events are processed immediately and stored in database
  - Batch validation and distance calculations leverage DuckDB capabilities
  - Caching of weights and distances reduces redundant computations
  - Increased batch size for validation sync improves throughput

  Database Architecture:
  - Migrated from SQLite to DuckDB for better performance
  - Replaced monolithic storage with specialized repositories
  - Multi-connection management for transaction isolation
  - Improved connection lifecycle with graceful shutdown
  - Better error handling with specific database error types

  Search and Graph Features:
  - Improved search algorithm for more accurate results
  - Added mutual follow detection for relationship analysis
  - Enhanced social graph analysis capabilities
  - Better metrics validation with TTL support

  Code Quality:
  - Added ESLint with TypeScript support for better code quality
  - Improved error handling throughout the application
  - Better initialization and logging for easier troubleshooting
  - Cleaner service architecture with separation of concerns
