description: >-
  Relatr is a decentralized web of trust metric service for Nostr that computes personalized trust scores by combining social graph distances with profile validation metrics.
  Relatr measures relative trust between Nostr public keys by analyzing social graph proximity and validating profile characteristics. It uses a weighted scoring system to produce a comprehensive trust metric that can be personalized from any source pubkey's perspective.

  Features:
  - Web-Based Configuration UI: Manage environment variables through a browser interface
  - Social Graph Analysis: Calculates trust distances using nostr-social-graph
  - Profile Validation: Validates NIP-05, Lightning addresses, and event publications
  - Reciprocity Checking: Verifies mutual follow relationships
  - Configurable Scoring: Flexible weighting schemes for different trust factors
  - Persistent Caching: SQLite-based caching for performance optimization
  - MCP Server Interface: Model Context Protocol API for integration

  The service is designed to be resource-efficient with minimal hardware requirements, requiring only 256MB RAM and 256MB storage for basic operation.
