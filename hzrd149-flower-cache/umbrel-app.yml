description: >-
  A high-performance Blossom proxy server that caches blobs locally and proxies requests to upstream Blossom servers. Implements BUD-01 and BUD-10 URL schemas for decentralized blob storage and retrieval.

  Features:
  - Streaming Responses: Streams blob data to clients immediately as it arrives from upstream servers, reducing latency for large files
  - Incremental Hash Calculation: Calculates SHA-256 hash incrementally while streaming, validating blob integrity without buffering
  - Streaming Cache Writes: Writes blobs to cache incrementally as data arrives, minimizing memory usage
  - Request Deduplication: Multiple concurrent requests for the same blob share a single upstream fetch, eliminating redundant network traffic
  - Local Caching: Automatically caches downloaded blobs to disk for fast subsequent access
  - LRU Cache Pruning: Automatically removes least-recently-used blobs when cache size limit is exceeded
  - SHA-256 Validation: Validates blob integrity before caching to ensure data integrity
  - ETag Support: Implements HTTP ETags for efficient client-side caching (304 Not Modified responses)
  - Range Requests: Supports HTTP range requests for partial content delivery (video streaming, resume downloads)
  - Multi-Server Proxying: Tries multiple upstream servers in order until blob is found
  - CORS Support: Full CORS headers for cross-origin requests
  - Author Server Resolution: BUD-03 author server list resolution for automatic server discovery
  - High Performance: Built with Bun for maximum speed
